              <p>
                Every adventure starts with a single step. From the mountains of Vermont to the 
                bustling streets of New York, from ancient temples in India to trying new cuisines 
                around the world - each experience shapes who I am.
              </p>
              <p>
                This isn't just a bucket list. It's a commitment to living fully, exploring boldly, 
                and creating memories that last a lifetime. Join me as I check off dreams and 
                discover new ones along the way.
