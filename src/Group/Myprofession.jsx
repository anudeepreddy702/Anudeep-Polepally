              <h3>My Journey</h3>
              <p>
                Growing up, I always had an insatiable curiosity about the world. Every place
                I visited, every culture I experienced, and every person I met shaped who I am today.
                This bucket list isn't just a checklistâ€”it's a testament to my commitment to living
                life fully and intentionally.
              </p>

                <img src="src/assets/IMG_2741.jpg" alt="Adventure moment" />
              </div>
              
              <p>
                From the bustling streets of Times Square to the serene temples of India, from
                learning to play guitar to experiencing the thrill of driving an excavator, each
                item represents a piece of my journey toward becoming the person I want to be.

              <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
              <blockquote>
                "Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that
                take our breath away."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                I believe in pushing boundaries, stepping out of comfort zones, and embracing
                both the big adventures and small joys. Whether it's attending an F1 race,
                visiting all 50 US states, or simply learning to bake bread, every goal matters.

              <p>
                The adventure never stops! I'm currently working towards attending a Martin Garrix
                concert, running a marathon, and exploring more of India's incredible heritage sites.
                I'm also passionate about photography, entrepreneurship, and building meaningful
                connections with people around the world.
